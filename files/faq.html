                <summary>Do I need special equipment for yoga practice?</summary>
                <div>
                    Hardly. All you need is a nonslip yoga mat that is long enough to
                    lay fully stretched on your back.

                <div>
                    Meditation can be practiced every day. Beginners can target 5-10
                    mins a day, and those with more experience can work up to 30-60 mins
                    twice a day or more.

                <div>
                    Yes! Everyone can do Yoga, and there is no limit to who can or who
                    cannot. You may feel intimidated or discouraged seeing a lot of
                    performative Yoga on social media.

                <summary>How are Yoga Asanas different from exercise?</summary>
                <div>
                    Exercises focus more on physical strength and the ability to do
                    strenuous tasks. Regular exercise helps you develop greater control
                    over your movements and range of motion.

                <summary>What are the benefits of yoga?</summary>
                <div>
                    Practising yoga has loads of physical benefits: it creates a flexible, toned and strong body and
                    improves breathing,
                    energy and metabolism.
