            <!-- The traditional yoga teaching method involves students imitating postures after an instructor,
            which can lead to poor breathing, incorrect alignment, and injury. Online yoga classes and tutorial
            videos have gained popularity, but they lack real-time feedback and correction. The study aims to
            provide real-time advice and feedback to address these issues and make yoga instruction more
            accessible and of higher quality. The research challenge is to create a novel system that offers
            realtime coaching to
            practitioners, improving their performance and preventing accidents. The
            proposed approach aims to improve alignment and breathing, enhance learning experiences, and
            increase the efficacy of yoga practice by offering 3D renderings of genuine asanas and real-time
            feedback, including error checking. This approach aims to make yoga instruction more accessible
            and useful for practitioners of all skill levels. -->
